# SmartHomeEnergyAssistant

A small-scale project to explore foundational technologies in Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Edge Computing, Blockchain, and Serverless Architecture. This assistant simulates energy consumption analysis, provides energy-saving recommendations, ensures data transparency using blockchain, and offers backend functionality through serverless services.

Features
Edge Computing: Simulates energy consumption data collection using a local device.
Machine Learning: Analyzes patterns and identifies energy-saving opportunities.
Blockchain: Secures and verifies consumption data for transparency.
Serverless Architecture: Provides backend services for analysis and recommendations.
